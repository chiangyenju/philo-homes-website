## üí∏ Cost Breakdown

### Replicate (Most Affordable)
- Room Generation: ~$0.02 per image
- Furniture Detection: ~$0.01 per analysis  
- Furniture Swapping: ~$0.03 per swap
- **Total per complete design**: ~$0.06

### Example Usage Costs
- **10 room designs**: ~$0.60
- **100 room designs**: ~$6.00
- **1000 room designs**: ~$60.00

### Hugging Face (Free Tier)
- **Free**: 1000 requests/month

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Setup (Optional)

### Enable Multiple AI Providers
Add multiple API keys to use different services for different tasks:

```bash
# Use Replicate for generation, OpenAI for detection
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here

# Use Hugging Face for free testing
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
```

### Add Image Storage
Store generated images in the cloud:

```bash
# AWS S3 (recommended for production)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

# Cloudinary (easier setup)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### Add User Authentication
Enable user accounts and saved designs:

```bash
# Clerk (recommended)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "No API key found" Message
- Check that your `.env.local` file is in the project root
- Verify the API key name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Restart the development server after adding keys

### API Errors
- **Rate Limited**: Wait a few minutes and try again
- **Invalid Key**: Double-check your API key
- **Insufficient Credits**: Check your account balance

### Slow Generation
- **Normal**: First generation takes 15-30 seconds
- **Network**: Check your internet connection  
- **Server Load**: AI providers can be slower during peak times

### Demo Mode
If you see demo images instead of AI-generated ones:
- You're probably missing API keys
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your API key is correctly set
